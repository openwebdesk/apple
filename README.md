# Apple
Apple is a functional local CLI based JS environment with a VFS and an application system, where applications recieve parameters on startup.

## Intention
OWD Apple is not intended for regular users, though, anyone can use it. It doesn't have a visual user interface by default. It's an abstract system purely for the purposes of abstraction.

## Contribute
OWD Apple is Open-Source. You can contribute to it by opening a pull request.
